				<p class="text-lead text-ubc-blue-cobalt">As an employee of the University, there are several resources
					that the University and the Plan provide for new and current employees. Pension plans are complex
					and may not be easy to understand, which is why the Plan provides the following information sessions
					and workshops to help you understand pension plans, the Staff Pension Plan, and how they might help
					you with your financial and retirement planning.</p>
				<p>Understanding Your Staff Pension Plan (UYSPP) is an informative workshop session designed for both
					potential and current members of the UBC Staff Pension Plan. All ages are welcome to attend. If you
					are close to retiring, you may want to consider booking a Retirement Information Session (RIS)
					rather than attending the workshop, as weâ€™ll be able to review your specific situation including
					pension estimates.</p>
				<p>If you are already a Plan member, regardless of age, this workshop will help you learn more about the
					Plan, pensions in general, and related retirement considerations. If you are interested in
					retirement planning, this workshop will help you understand your retirement options. If you are not
					yet a member, this workshop will provide enrolment information and an opportunity to have all of
					your pension-related questions answered.</p>
				<p>Advance registration is required. Please note that registration cut-off time is 24 hours before the
					workshop.</p>
